    'Pairwise was designed to make voting in Retro Funding simple and fun. Pairwise is an open-source, off-chain voting dapp (like Snapshot) that streamlines community signaling by letting users select between just two options and then aggregating their choices into a quantifiable result.\nPairwise is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to make many simple choices and then the algorithm behind the scenes pumps out a final ranking for them to adjust or approve. \n\n* RF3: Served as an alternative tool for creating lists and subcategories for 600+ projects.\n* RF4: Ran its own independent experiment enabling different stakeholder groups to signal how to distribute RF promoting project discovery with pseudonymous voting.\n* RF5: After our great work on RF4, we were invited to be an official voting option to gamify and simplify the badgeholder decision making process. Allowing Badgeholders to create their ballot using our app.',

This allowed all stakeholders‚Äîbadgeholders, token holders, recipients, and delegates‚Äîto participate freely without pressure and promote project discovery. We also distributed 4,000 OP as rewards, a 100OP to 40 lucky winners. Here you can find the [final results](https://www.pairwise.vote/rf4-results), and our [blog conclusions](https://paragraph.xyz/@pairwise) for more details on our outcomes.\n\nThe feedback from RF4 was very positive, leading to an invite to build with Optimism for RF5. For this round, we developed a star rating system, enabling participants to assign stars to projects before comparing them. This system grouped projects into tiers, significantly reducing the number of comparisons.',

Pairwise also sparks discussions by comparing its results to official ones, fostering deeper insights and driving more meaningful participation and progress to decentralization.\n\nThe foundation‚Äôs implementation of RetroFunding was clearly informed by our work and [feedback](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-3-feedback-thread/6177/150?u=griff).
